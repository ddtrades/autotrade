To those who have never written a program before
*Congratulations!!*
You have just written your first python program.

To those more experienced a little more patience and we will soon start our algo trading lessons.


### A few python concepts before we start with algo trading lessons

Trust me!
Programming is easy.

You need NOT know everything and every construct of python & programming for you to start writing some workable programs.
Here are a few things that will help you kick-start your journey.

* Program file: `A text file where you write your program`
* Statement: `A line in the program file that instructs the computer to do something`
* Function: Think of it as a command. For e.g. You press an electric switch. A bulb will light up. `press_switch` can be expressed as function. You need not know how exacty is the light bulb turned on. all you need to know is when you `press_switch` the bulb will light up.
  In our first program `print` was a function. It is responsible for printing the input that you have provided which is `HELLO WORLD!`.
* Variable: Let's remember our school days - where algebra was either the most interesting subject or the most hated subject. But we all might remember defining the unknown as 'x'.
  `x` & `y` are example of variable. We can use any alphanumeric characters as a variable and we save values in it.
```
x=10
name="danish"
last_name='ali'
```
* Math Operations:
```
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y
print(z)
print(x * 
y)
print(x/y)
```
